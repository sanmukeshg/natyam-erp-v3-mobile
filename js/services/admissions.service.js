/**
 * NATYAM ERP 2.0 — Admissions service
 *
 * The admissions pipeline and, at the end of it, the single most consequential
 * operation in the product: turning an approved application into a student.
 *
 * 1.0's version of that conversion is the bug this whole rebuild was shaped
 * around. It copied the application's fields onto a new student record but
 * never set `batchId`, because the application form had no batch field. The
 * student was created successfully, the toast said so, and they then appeared
 * on no roll call, in no batch roster and in no attendance report — visible
 * only in the students table, apparently enrolled, silently untaught. Here,
 * conversion refuses to proceed without a batch, and the wizard collects one.
